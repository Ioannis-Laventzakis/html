    <h1>Hello, my name is Ioannis</h1>
    <img src="new.jpg" width="150" height="120">
    <p>And I'm on a journey to learn Java programming. I'm passionate about technology and eager to explore the world of
        Java development.</p>
    <p>I'm from Crete, and I've been living in Germany for the past 9 years.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include sports, and I'm passionate about both boxing and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Boxing keeps me
        physically active and sharpens my striking skills, while Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu allows me to explore the world of
        ground fighting and submission techniques. In addition to sports, I also enjoy playing video games to relax and
        have fun.</p>
    <p>One of the most important aspects of my life is spending quality time with my kids.</p>
    <p>Professionally, I have valuable experience working in a hospital for 2 years. In the hospital, I was responsible
        for sterilization and transporting equipment into the operation rooms.</p>
